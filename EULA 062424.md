Your withdrawal of consent will become effective when Skillable mails you a copy of the non-electronic form of the ToU, at which point your relationship with Skillable will be governed by the terms of such ToU. In either instance, the obligations that you incur pursuant to the electronic form of these ToU, prior to the effective date of the withdrawal of your consent, will remain unchanged until they are fully satisfied by you.

    In order to access and retain the electronic ToU, you must have access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based and/or mobile content, and pay any charges associated with such access.
